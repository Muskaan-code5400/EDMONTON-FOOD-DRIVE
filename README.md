# EDMONTON-FOOD-DRIVE
In order to help Edmonton's neighborhoods, this initiative will plan and oversee a sizable food drive, with an emphasis on supplying food to people and families that are facing food insecurity. In order to guarantee that people in need have access to wholesome meals, the main goal is to gather non-perishable food products and give them to them. This project involved various phases such as colleccting data from volunteers regarding the food drive, cleaning the data, making necessary changes, merging datasets, deployig machine learning models, evaluating the models based on their performance and making predictions for future food drive.
